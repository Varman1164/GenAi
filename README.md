# Flower Recognition Using CNN

This project is a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing the correct Flower. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing flowers without their names.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Flower Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) by Alexander Mamaev, which contains over 4,242 images of various flowers.The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

I've installed these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```
